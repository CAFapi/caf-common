Welcome to CAF Common an open source collection of reusable Java components from the CAF team. The components within this repository are used in the construction of [CAF](http://cafapi.github.io/) services and frameworks such as the Worker Framework, Data Processing and Job Service.

The development team make best efforts to ensure their components have minimal dependencies allowing these components to be deployed easily. Additionally, components will keep their interfaces as stable as possible, so that CAF developers, as well as other open source projects, can reuse these components without having to worry about changes in the future.

Components are versioned using [Semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).
